## üó£Ô∏è About 42

	42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology:
	no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer
	learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is
	free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming
	thus "cadets" (42's students).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills developed at 42cursus

### Hard-skills

	* C/C++ language, Makefile
	* Shell scripting
	* Git
	* Networks
	* Docker
	* SQL
	* Web (HTML, CSS, Wordpress)
	* Computer graphics
	* Assembly language

### Soft-skills

	# Self-learning and proactivity
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
		work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
		levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
		contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
		demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.

## Functions

### Libft

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn‚Äôt have access to the highly useful standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them.

### Born2beRoot

This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.
Creating a machine in VirtualBox under specific instructions and set up
a Linux operating system while implementing strict rules in Shell. 

### Printf

This project is pretty straightforward,to recode the printf Functions.
You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions.

### Get_next_line

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.
